# Brainstorm Skill

## When to use this skill
- before implementing non-trivial features
- before refactors with unclear scope
- before debugging complex issues
- before designing an automation workflow

## Brainstorm template (use this exact structure)
### Goal
- (1–2 sentences)

### Constraints
- (tech stack, time, compatibility, performance, “must not change”, etc.)

### Known context
- (what exists today; relevant files/components; current behavior)

### Risks
- (security, data loss, regressions, surprising side effects)

### Options (2–4)
For each option include:
- Summary
- Pros / cons
- Complexity / risk

### Recommendation
- Pick one option and explain why

### Acceptance criteria
- Bullet list of verifiable outcomes
