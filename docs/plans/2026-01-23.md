# 2026-01-23: Vertical Slice & Core Building Blocks

**Focus**: Initial architectural foundations and proving end-to-end viability.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. **Core Architecture**

- **Defined**: Created `core-building-blocks-design.md` detailing the crate structure (`repo-fs`, `repo-git`, `repo-core`, managed blocks).
- **Decision**: Split functionality into specialized crates rather than a monolith.
- **Decision**: Use `normalized_path` (repo-fs) to handle cross-platform path issues safely.

### 2. **Phase 1 Implementation**

- **Plan**: `phase1-vertical-slice.md`
- **Accomplishment**: Implemented `repo-blocks` (managed block parsing/writing with UUID markers).
- **Accomplishment**: Implemented `repo-meta` (config schema).
- **Accomplishment**: Implemented `repo-presets` (provider interface).
- **Accomplishment**: Implemented `repo-tools` (integration traits).

### 3. **Content Design**

- **Designed**: `repo-content-design.md` established the `Document`/`FormatHandler` pattern.
- **Key Concept**: Abstact over file formats (TOML, YAML, JSON) to allow precise, format-aware editing.

## Key Artifacts

- `phase1-vertical-slice.md`: Detailed implementation steps for the first 5 crates.
- `core-building-blocks-design.md`: The architectural blueprint.
