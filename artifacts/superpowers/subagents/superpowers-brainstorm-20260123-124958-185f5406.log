=== PROMPT ===
You are a specialized subagent focused on: superpowers-brainstorm

IMPORTANT: You have ISOLATED CONTEXT. Do not assume knowledge from other conversations.

Task:
Research Rust patterns for 1) Managing Git Worktrees using gix, and 2) A plugin system for a CLI (separate binaries vs WASM). Compare with projen/nx concepts.

Skill Instructions:
---
name: superpowers-brainstorm
description: Produces a structured brainstorm: goals, constraints, risks, options, recommendation, and acceptance criteria. Use before non-trivial implementation or design changes.

# Brainstorm Skill

## When to use this skill
- before implementing non-trivial features
- before refactors with unclear scope
- before debugging complex issues
- before designing an automation workflow

## Brainstorm template (use this exact structure)
### Goal
- (1–2 sentences)

### Constraints
- (tech stack, time, compatibility, performance, “must not change”, etc.)

### Known context
- (what exists today; relevant files/components; current behavior)

### Risks
- (security, data loss, regressions, surprising side effects)

### Options (2–4)
For each option include:
- Summary
- Pros / cons
- Complexity / risk

### Recommendation
- Pick one option and explain why

### Acceptance criteria
- Bullet list of verifiable outcomes


Requirements:
1. Follow the skill instructions exactly
2. Complete the task fully
3. Output ONLY the final result at the end
4. Do not include meta-commentary or thinking process in final output
5. Write any artifacts to artifacts/superpowers/subagent-185f5406/

When complete, output:
---SUBAGENT-RESULT-START---
[Your final result here]
---SUBAGENT-RESULT-END---


=== EXECUTION ===

=== STDOUT ===
---SUBAGENT-RESULT-START---

Error executing tool run_shell_command: The @lydell/node-pty package supports your platform (win32-x64), but it could not find the binary package for it: @lydell/node-pty-win32-x64/conpty.node

This can happen if you use the "--omit=optional" (or "--no-optional") npm flag.
The "optionalDependencies" package.json feature is used to install the correct
binary executable for your current platform. Remove that flag to use @lydell/node-pty.

This can also happen if the "node_modules" folder was copied between two operating systems
that need different binaries - including "virtual" operating systems like Docker and WSL.
If so, try installing with npm rather than copying "node_modules".
